# COVID-19 Data Analytics Project
This project is a guided data analytics case study inspired by Alex The Analyst's YouTube series. It focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data using MS SQL Server for data exploration and Tableau for data visualization.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to practice real-world data analytics skills by:
- Writing SQL queries to explore trends in COVID-19 case and death counts
- Identifying insights such as country-specific death rates and vaccination progress
- Creating an interactive dashboard to visualize global trends and support data-driven storytelling

## Tools Used
- MS SQL Server
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel

## Project Breakdown
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Cleaned and normalized datasets for accurate analysis
- Managed null values and ensured consistent date formatting

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)
Wrote complex SQL queries to:
- Compare cases vs deaths globally and by country
- Track infection rates over time
- Analyze vaccination progress by country
- Identify countries with the highest death rates relative to population

### 3. Data Visualization (Dashboard)
Built an interactive dashboard to display:
- Total cases and deaths over time
- Country-specific comparisons
- Vaccination trends and insights

## Key Takeaways
- Reinforced data querying skills using SQL on real-world datasets
- Learned to create clear, informative visualizations to communicate complex insights
- Gained hands-on experience with end-to-end data analysis and presentation
