# Fitbit Tracker Analysis Report
Analysing activity, sleep, and caloric trends using Fitbit data

**Data set:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit

**Problem Statement** \
Despite the abundance of wearable fitness devices, users often struggle to interpret their data in a meaningful way. This project seeks to analyse behavioural patterns captured through Fitbit data to answer key questions related to physical activity, sleep quality, calorie expenditure, and lifestyle consistency. The goal is to convert raw data into actionable health insights for individual users and help product teams design better dashboards and interventions.

**Business Questions**
1.	Which days of the week show the highest and lowest physical activity across users?
2.	How consistent are users in meeting daily activity goals (e.g., 7500+ steps)?
3.	Is there a correlation between more sleep and greater calorie expenditure?
4.	How are users distributed across sedentary, lightly active, and very active lifestyle bands?
5.	How does sleep duration affect daily step counts and energy burned?
