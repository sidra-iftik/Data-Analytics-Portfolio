# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

**Data set:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

## Problem statement
### Problem:
The HR department of a mid-sized organization is facing high employee attrition* and lacks clarity on the underlying causes. With rising recruitment and training costs, it’s critical to identify which roles, departments, and conditions are most likely to lead to employee turnover. \
_*Attrition is when employees leave the workforce faster than the rate at which their employers hire. Vacancies remain open longer, or the role is eliminated._
### Objective:
Analyse employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction metrics, and compensation to uncover patterns in attrition. Use SQL to produce reports that identify risk factors, department-level trends, and potential areas for intervention, ultimately helping the organization retain top talent and improve job satisfaction.

## Business Questions
1.	What is the overall attrition rate in the company?
2.	Which departments or job roles have the highest attrition rates?
3.	Is there a correlation between job satisfaction or environment satisfaction and attrition?
4.	What is the average age, income, and experience of employees who left vs those who stayed?
5.	Are overtime hours contributing to attrition?
6.	How does attrition vary by education level or business travel frequency?
7.	What’s the distribution of attrition across monthly income bands?
8.	Which locations (if available) or education fields show the lowest retention?
