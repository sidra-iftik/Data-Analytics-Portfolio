## Problem Statement

**Problem:**
The regional sales team at a large retail chain is struggling to understand which products and markets are driving profits, and which are hurting performance. Despite high sales volume, profit margins are inconsistent, and inventory is not always aligned with demand. The management team needs a clear, data-driven dashboard to uncover performance trends, identify growth opportunities, and flag problem areas across product categories and geographic regions.

**Objective:**
Build a dynamic Excel dashboard that allows stakeholders to interactively explore sales, profit, and quantity trends by category, sub-category, and region. The dashboard should highlight key drivers of performance and uncover areas for strategic action.

## Business Questions
1.	Which regions are generating the most sales and profit?
2.	Which product categories and sub-categories are most and least profitable?
3.	How do sales and profits vary over time (monthly/quarterly)?
4.	Are there any product segments where high sales donâ€™t translate to high profit?
5.	Which customer segments contribute most to revenue?
6.	What is the average discount rate, and how does it affect profitability?
